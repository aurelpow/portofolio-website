An end-to-end, reproducible **machine learning pipeline** to forecast **NBA player points** from historical data.  
The project combines **data engineering** 🏗️, **feature engineering** 🧩, and **ML modeling** 🤖, designed for both **local experiments** 💻 and **cloud deployment** ☁️.

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Data pipeline** 🛠️: ingest NBA stats via `nba_api`; clean & build per-game player features (rolling means, usage/pace proxies, opponent strength, rest days).
- **Modeling** 📊: baseline regressors → LightGBM; time-aware CV; metrics: **MAE**, **RMSE**.
- **Inference** 🚀: batch predictions for upcoming slates; outputs: **local CSV** or **BigQuery**.
- **Engineering** 🧱: modular repo; env pinning; Docker 🐳; deploy on **Cloud Run** ☁️; one-command `run_all.sh`.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Add automatic retraining & evaluation 🔁.
- Extend predictions to assists, rebounds, turnovers 🏆.
- Integrate injury & lineup data 🏥.
- Enhance explainability with SHAP values for feature impact 💡.
